# spring-rest
Boilerplate code for Spring based REST web services.

I have created this boilerplate code with the idea of the same app that I have used for my other framework codings.
I used springframework this time to implement the same functionality of a BookLibrary REST API. For backend I am already using mongodb for my other projects so I have used the same collections of mongodb here too, and for working with mongodb I have used Spring Data MongoDB templates and MongoDB java client driver. If you have gonethrough my other REST API code you would see I have also added HATEOAS so that its easy to navigate the API, Spring also has a HATEOAS support inside the framework so I have also 
added that so that its easy to navigate the REST web service.

**Note**
This is still in development so things will be coming up in my new commits.
Keep watching till then and dont forget to star or fork this if you liked it.
